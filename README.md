###### Description

This is a US compatible LoRa module (SX1276, 915MHz). LoRa module can send and receive data in a very long distance but consume very low power. We made a Qwiic version of this LoRa module, no soldering and jumper wire connections, just Qwiic cable plugin, and have fun! 

LoRa module is powerful, it can send and receive data packets at up to 10KM distance, and consumes very low power (10mA for receiver, 120mA for transmitter).

LoRa itself is a SPI device, in order to turn it into a I2C device, we added a MCU (ATMEGA328P) as the gateway to do the dirty work for you, you just need to use the moduleâ€™s I2C interface to communicate with the others. It is just that easy.
 
The button on the board is for pairing function, check [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_QwiicRF_Library/wiki) for more details.

> Note: This LoRa module is based on SX1276 RFM95W-915S2, the frequency is 915 MHz, check [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country.html) to see if this can be used in your country.
